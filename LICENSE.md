I don't mind if you play my game, use my code, or fork a new version. The original wordle 
game which this imitates is owned by the New York Times. So if you try to use my code for 
any commercial purpose, it is against my recommendation, and foolish unless you can afford 
hefty legal fees ... followed by a significant find.

Otherwise, have fun.
